This morning I needed to transform textmate snippets bundle into a Gedit format.

I've made this quick and dirty is someone need it.

I'll probably improve it in the future.

*How to use*

Copy your textmate Snippets directory into the tmsnippets2gedit folder, run ruby tmsnippets2gedit.rb

This will convert all you need and create a result.xml file. Edit this file and replace [LANGUAGE] with your language.

*nokogiri*

you'll need nokogiri in order to use this script, so sudo gem install nokogiri
